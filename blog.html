      <p class="blog">
        How to adapt to night shift?<br><br><br>
        Adapting to night shift has been a problem for newbies who join corporates or any other industry. <br><br><br><br><br> 
        There are few steps that will be useful for you. <br><br><br><br><br>       
        I too work in night shift. All the tips which I’m writing are those tips which I practice in my daily life. <br><br><br>
        I’m sure that it will be useful for those people who work in night shift. <br><br><br><br><br>       
        Try to implement these:<br><br>
        <ol class="blog">
          <li> Sleep at least for 6 hours. If you sleep for 8 hours that will be better. And if you really sleep for 8+ hours that’s the best.</li>
          <li>Eat proper food and maintain a healthy diet.</li>
          <li>more water.</li>
          <li>Avoid drinking tea and coffee.</li>        
          <li>Eat organic.</li>        
          <li>Exercise daily. Either you go to gym or exercise in your house.</li>        
          <li>will hardly find time to play in the playground. So if you get weekend off don’t waste the opportunity.</li>        
          <li>And one last thing. When you get more days of vacation don’t forget to sleep late during the final night of vacation because if you sleep early on that night you won’t be able to work in your next late shift (night shift).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="blog">
